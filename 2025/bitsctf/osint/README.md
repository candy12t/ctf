Good work. Now when you hear Chris Martin say "You know I love you so...." for the beat drop, I need you to use your Flipper Zero to send the correct data stream, replicating the wristbands colour exactly. Our enemies should have no clue. Good Luck.
Data Stream: 1400 1400 700 700 700 700 1400 2800 700 2100 700 700 700 1400 700 1400 1400 2800 1400 2800 700
